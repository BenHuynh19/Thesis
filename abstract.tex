\chapter*{Abstract}

This study, using a statistical test proposed by Basak, Jagannathan, and Sun (2002), examines the performances of multifactor and sector diversification. Results from the full sample testing indicate that the former outperformed persistently the latter with statistical significances, while the conclusion was blurrier during the pandemic period. Unlike other research, which try to deliberately construct original factors with individual stocks (Briere and Szafarz (2021), for instance), this paper leverages the availability of exchange traded funds (ETFs), whose purposes are to reproduce the risk premiums of multifactor portfolios, hence it provides more practical implementations of the research outcomes.
